I am a machine learning engineer in **Tencent@IEG**. I received my Master's degree in Electronic Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU) in 2024. Before that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Technology from SJTU.

When I was a student, I worked on research in 3D human pose estimation, 3D human mesh recovery, object animating, structured illuminational microscopy, advised by <u>Dr. Zhenbo Yu</u>, <u>Prof. Bing Bing Ni</u>, <u>Prof. Xiaoyan Wu</u>. I also participated in virtual avatar projects in <u>MetaCube Lab</u> in SJTU. After graduation (up to now), I have been working on the application of latest machine learning techniques in game industries. 

I have broad interests in games and 3D vision tasks (e.g. **3D Generative Models**, Motion Capture, Differentible Rendering). I am a beginner but keep working :).

In my life, I am a **metaphysics lover**. I love reading and photography.
